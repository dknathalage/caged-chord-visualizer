# Guitar Learning Path

A theory-first roadmap for building deep, confident knowledge of the guitar. Each phase builds on the last — don't rush. Spend real time at each stage until the concepts are second nature, not just memorized.

Each chapter has full theory explanations, hands-on exercises, and progress markers so you know when you've genuinely internalized a stage.

## Chapters

| # | Chapter | Focus | Exercises |
|---|---------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | [The Fretboard as a System](docs/ch1-fretboard.md) | Tuning, chromatic scale, note locations, octave shapes | Note naming, random note finder, octave jumping, dot map |
| 2 | [Intervals](docs/ch2-intervals.md) | The distance between notes — the core language of music | Interval construction, naming drills, ear training, interval chains |
| 3 | [Building Chords](docs/ch3-chords.md) | Triads, 7ths, extensions, inversions — all from formulas | Triad/7th chord spelling, chord tone ID, major-to-minor conversion |
| 4 | [The CAGED System](docs/ch4-caged.md) | 5 interlocking shapes covering the entire fretboard | Barre chords, 5-position chord walks, shape analysis |
| 5 | [Scales and Modes](docs/ch5-scales.md) | Major scale, 7 modes, pentatonics, blues, harmonic minor | Single-string scales, box patterns, mode comparison, scale-chord connection |
| 6 | [Harmony and Progressions](docs/ch6-harmony.md) | Diatonic chords, functional harmony, secondary dominants | Key harmonization, progression analysis, borrowed chords |
| 7 | [Rhythm and Time](docs/ch7-rhythm.md) | Subdivisions, time signatures, syncopation, swing | Metronome drills, strum patterns, odd meters, shuffle feel |
| 8 | [Applying It All](docs/ch8-application.md) | Song analysis, improvisation, voice leading, arpeggios | Transposition, chord tone soloing, fingerpicking, call-and-response |
| 9 | [Advanced Concepts](docs/ch9-advanced.md) | Substitutions, altered dominants, modulation, melodic minor | Tritone subs, altered voicings, pivot modulation, modal vamp soloing |

## How to Use This

1. **Go in order.** Each chapter builds on the previous ones. Skipping ahead creates gaps.
2. **Do the exercises.** Reading theory without playing is useless. Every chapter has hands-on exercises with expected answers.
3. **Check the progress markers.** Each chapter ends with a checklist. Don't move on until you can honestly check every box.
4. **Use the visualizer.** The [CAGED Chord Visualizer](https://dknathalage.github.io/caged-chord-visualizer/) is your companion tool — use it especially in Chapters 4-6.
5. **Ask Claude.** The CLAUDE.md in this repo configures Claude as a guitar theory teacher. Ask it to quiz you, explain concepts, create exercises, or check your understanding.

## Practice Framework

### Daily Minimum (30 min)

| Block | Time | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| Warm-up | 5 min | Chromatic exercise or spider crawl with metronome |
| Theory drill | 5 min | Interval ear training, note finding, or chord formula quiz |
| Technique | 10 min | Current skill focus (barre chords, arpeggios, picking, etc.) |
| Application | 10 min | Song practice, improvisation, or progression work |

### Weekly Focus Rotation

- **Week 1**: Fretboard knowledge — notes, octave shapes, interval locations
- **Week 2**: Chord voicings — CAGED shapes, 7th chords, inversions
- **Week 3**: Scales and modes — new pattern, connect to chord shapes
- **Week 4**: Repertoire and improv — apply everything to real music

### Progress Markers

You've completed a phase when:

- **Chapter 1**: You can name any note on any string in under 3 seconds
- **Chapter 2**: You can identify all intervals by ear and locate them on the fretboard
- **Chapter 3**: You can build any chord from its formula without looking it up
- **Chapter 4**: You can play any major/minor chord in all 5 CAGED shapes
- **Chapter 5**: You can play all 7 modes in at least 2 positions and know their character
- **Chapter 6**: You can harmonize a major scale, identify progressions by ear, and use secondary dominants
- **Chapter 7**: You can play in odd time signatures and use syncopation naturally
- **Chapter 8**: You can improvise over changes, targeting chord tones with good phrasing
- **Chapter 9**: You can apply substitutions, altered dominants, and modulate between keys
