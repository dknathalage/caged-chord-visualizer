# Chapter 7 — Rhythm and Time

You can know every chord and scale, but without rhythm you can't make music. Rhythm is the dimension most self-taught guitarists neglect. This chapter covers the theory and practice of time.

---

## 7.1 Pulse, Beat, and Tempo

- **Pulse**: the steady heartbeat of music. Tap your foot — that's the pulse.
- **Beat**: a single pulse. In 4/4 time, there are 4 beats per measure (bar).
- **Tempo**: how fast the pulse moves, measured in BPM (beats per minute). 60 BPM = one beat per second. 120 BPM = two beats per second.

## 7.2 Note Values

| Value | Beats (in 4/4) | Symbol | Subdivision |
|-------|----------------|--------|------------|
| Whole note | 4 | o | 1 per bar |
| Half note | 2 | d | 2 per bar |
| Quarter note | 1 | ♩ | 4 per bar |
| Eighth note | 1/2 | ♪ | 8 per bar |
| Sixteenth note | 1/4 | ♬ | 16 per bar |
| Triplet (8th) | 1/3 | ♪³ | 12 per bar |

**Counting**:
- Quarter notes: **1 - 2 - 3 - 4**
- Eighth notes: **1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &**
- Sixteenth notes: **1 e & a 2 e & a 3 e & a 4 e & a**
- Triplets: **1 trip let 2 trip let 3 trip let 4 trip let**

## 7.3 Rests

A rest is silence that takes up the same duration as its note value. Quarter rest = 1 beat of silence. Rests are as important as notes — space is what gives rhythm its shape.

## 7.4 Time Signatures

The two numbers at the start of a piece:
- **Top number**: how many beats per measure
- **Bottom number**: which note value gets one beat

| Time Sig | Meaning | Feel | Examples |
|----------|---------|------|----------|
| 4/4 | 4 quarter notes per bar | Standard "straight" time | Most rock, pop, blues, jazz |
| 3/4 | 3 quarter notes per bar | Waltz | The Christmas Song, Norwegian Wood |
| 6/8 | 6 eighth notes per bar | Compound duple (2 groups of 3) | Nothing Else Matters, House of the Rising Sun |
| 2/4 | 2 quarter notes per bar | March, polka | Marching band music |
| 5/4 | 5 quarter notes per bar | Odd — asymmetric | Take Five, Mission Impossible |
| 7/8 | 7 eighth notes per bar | Odd — grouped 2+2+3 or 3+2+2 | Money (Pink Floyd) |
| 12/8 | 12 eighth notes per bar | Compound quadruple (4 groups of 3) | Slow blues shuffle |

## 7.5 Syncopation

Syncopation = accenting beats that aren't normally stressed. In 4/4, beats 1 and 3 are naturally strong. Syncopation emphasizes beats 2 and 4 (backbeat) or the "and" counts.

- **Backbeat**: snare drum hitting on 2 and 4 — the foundation of rock and pop
- **Off-beat**: strumming on the "&" counts, skipping the numbered beats
- **Anticipation**: playing a chord slightly before the beat it belongs to

Syncopation is what makes rhythm feel groovy versus mechanical.

## 7.6 Swing vs. Straight

- **Straight** eighth notes: each eighth note gets exactly half a beat. 1 & 2 & (evenly spaced)
- **Swing** eighth notes: the first eighth is held longer, the second is shorter. Gives a "bouncy" triplet feel. Common in jazz, blues, and shuffle patterns.

A common approximation: swing = the first eighth gets 2/3 of the beat, the second gets 1/3 (like a triplet with the first two tied).

## Exercises

### Exercise 7.1 — Metronome Fundamentals

**Goal**: Lock in with a metronome at different subdivisions.

Equipment: any metronome (phone app works fine).

1. **Quarter notes at 60 BPM**: strum a single chord (e.g., Am) on every click. Do this for 2 minutes straight without speeding up or slowing down.
2. **Eighth notes at 60 BPM**: strum down on the click, up between clicks (D-U-D-U). Maintain for 2 minutes.
3. **Sixteenth notes at 60 BPM**: D-D-U-U pattern (or strict alternate picking on a single note). This is 4 strums per click.
4. **Quarter notes at 120 BPM**: repeat step 1. Feel the doubled speed.
5. **Eighth notes at 80 BPM**: this is where most pop/rock songs live. Get very comfortable here.

If you can't stay locked with the metronome, slow down. Speed is not the goal — accuracy is.

### Exercise 7.2 — Basic Strumming Patterns

**Goal**: Internalize the most common strum patterns.

Use an open G chord (or any chord you're comfortable with). D = downstroke, U = upstroke, (miss) = strum through the air without hitting strings.

**Pattern 1 — All Downstrokes** (quarter notes):
```
Beat:  1   2   3   4
Strum: D   D   D   D
```

**Pattern 2 — Down-Up** (eighth notes):
```
Beat:  1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &
Strum: D U D U D U D U
```

**Pattern 3 — Folk/Pop** (the most versatile pattern):
```
Beat:  1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &
Strum: D   D   U   U D U
```
(Miss the up on beat 1&, miss the down on beat 3)

**Pattern 4 — Reggae/Offbeat**:
```
Beat:  1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &
Strum:   U   U   U   U
```
(Strum only on the "&" — the offbeats)

**Pattern 5 — 16th note funk**:
```
Beat:  1 e & a 2 e & a 3 e & a 4 e & a
Strum: D   U   D x U   D   U   D   U
```
(x = ghost strum / muted hit)

Practice each pattern for 2 minutes with a metronome at 70 BPM. Once solid, apply to chord progressions.

### Exercise 7.3 — Chord Changes on the Beat

**Goal**: Change chords in time without slowing down.

Using pattern 3 (D _ D _ U _ U D U) at 60 BPM:

1. Play **G** for one bar, then **C** for one bar. Repeat 8 times.
2. The chord change must happen exactly on beat 1 of the new bar — not late.
3. If you can't change fast enough, simplify: just play beat 1 of the new chord, skip the pattern, then rejoin on beat 2.
4. Once comfortable: G(1 bar) - C(1 bar) - D(1 bar) - G(1 bar). Repeat.
5. Increase tempo by 5 BPM when you can do 4 loops cleanly.

### Exercise 7.4 — Counting Out Loud

**Goal**: Internalize subdivisions by vocalizing them.

1. Set metronome to 60 BPM
2. Count aloud "1, 2, 3, 4" with each click while strumming quarter notes
3. Count "1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and" while strumming eighth notes
4. Count "1 e and a 2 e and a..." while strumming sixteenth notes
5. Now mute the strings (rest your palm on them) and count "1, 2, 3, 4" but only strum on beats 2 and 4 (backbeat)

This is harder than it sounds. Counting while playing builds independence between your voice and hands.

### Exercise 7.5 — 3/4 Time (Waltz)

**Goal**: Feel a different meter.

Set metronome to 90 BPM (3 clicks per bar in 3/4 time).

**Basic waltz strum** using Am:
```
Beat:  1     2     3
Strum: D(bass) U U
```
- Beat 1: strum only the bass note (string 5 for Am)
- Beats 2-3: strum the treble strings

Play: Am (1 bar) - E (1 bar) - Am (1 bar) - Dm (1 bar). Repeat.

Feel how the emphasis on beat 1 creates a "ONE two three ONE two three" pulse.

### Exercise 7.6 — Triplet Feel

**Goal**: Subdivide into three instead of two.

1. Set metronome to 60 BPM
2. Play 3 evenly spaced notes per click on a single string: "1-trip-let, 2-trip-let, 3-trip-let, 4-trip-let"
3. Now accent only the first of each triplet: "**1**-trip-let, **2**-trip-let..."
4. Now try a shuffle: play only the 1st and 3rd note of each triplet, skipping the middle. This gives you the swing feel: "1...let, 2...let, 3...let, 4...let"
5. Apply the shuffle to a chord strum over a 12-bar blues in A: A7 (4 bars) - D7 (2 bars) - A7 (2 bars) - E7 (1 bar) - D7 (1 bar) - A7 (2 bars)

### Exercise 7.7 — Rhythmic Precision Test

**Goal**: Check if you're truly locked in.

1. Set metronome to 80 BPM
2. Strum a chord on beats 1 and 3 only (half notes)
3. Now remove the chord and just tap your foot on every beat while snapping fingers on 2 and 4 only
4. Add the guitar back: strum on 1 and 3, tap foot on every beat, snap (or nod) on 2 and 4
5. If any of these layers drift from the metronome, slow down and isolate the problem

### Exercise 7.8 — Odd Time Signature Introduction

**Goal**: Experience 5/4 and 7/8 time.

**5/4 time** (grouped as 3+2):
```
Beat:  1  2  3  | 1  2  |
Count: ONE two three FOUR five
Strum: D  D  D    D   D
```
Play Am for 5 beats, then Em for 5 beats. Count aloud. Repeat until it feels natural.

**7/8 time** (grouped as 2+2+3):
```
Beat:  1 2 | 1 2 | 1 2 3 |
Count: ONE two THREE four FIVE six sev'n
```
Strum Em using this grouping. Accent beats 1, 3, and 5.

These feel strange at first — that's normal. The goal is comfort with asymmetric meter.
