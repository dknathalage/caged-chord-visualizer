# Chapter 9 — Advanced Concepts

This chapter covers tools for breaking out of diatonic harmony and basic scales. These concepts require solid foundations in Chapters 1-8 — don't rush here.

## 9.1 Chord Substitutions

Substitution = replacing a chord with a different chord that serves the same function but adds harmonic interest.

### Tritone Substitution

The most powerful substitution in jazz:
- Replace any **dominant 7th chord** with the dom7 chord a **tritone (6 semitones) away**
- Works because both chords share the same tritone interval (the 3rd and b7 swap roles)

| Original | Tritone Sub | Shared Notes |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| G7 (G B D F) | Db7 (Db F Ab B) | B and F are in both |
| C7 (C E G Bb) | Gb7 (Gb Bb Db E) | E and Bb are in both |
| D7 (D F# A C) | Ab7 (Ab C Eb F#) | F# and C are in both |

Example: **Dm7 - G7 - Cmaj7** becomes **Dm7 - Db7 - Cmaj7** — the bass walks down chromatically (D, Db, C).

### Relative Major/Minor Substitution

Replace a chord with its relative:
- Any major chord can be replaced by the minor chord a minor 3rd (3 semitones) below
- C → Am, F → Dm, G → Em
- Works because they share 2 of 3 notes

### Diminished Passing Chord

Insert a diminished 7th chord between two diatonic chords:
- **C - C#dim7 - Dm7** — the C#dim7 acts as a chromatic approach
- **Am - A#dim7 - Bm7b5** — same concept

### Backdoor Dominant

Instead of V7 → I, use **bVII7 → I**:
- In C: **Bb7 → Cmaj7** instead of G7 → Cmaj7
- Common in jazz standards, creates a softer resolution

## 9.2 Altered Dominants

The V7 chord is the most flexible chord in harmony — it tolerates extreme alteration because its function (resolving to I) is so strong.

| Alteration | Formula | Sound | Use |
|-----------|---------|-------|-----|
| 7b9 | 1 3 5 b7 b9 | Dark, tense | Minor key dominants |
| 7#9 | 1 3 5 b7 #9 | Aggressive, gritty | "Hendrix chord," blues-rock |
| 7b5 | 1 3 b5 b7 | Unstable, wanting resolution | Tritone emphasis |
| 7#5 | 1 3 #5 b7 | Augmented, mysterious | Augmented dominant |
| 7#11 | 1 3 5 b7 9 #11 | Lydian dominant | Jazz over IV chords |
| 7alt | 1 3 b7 + any altered tensions | Maximum tension | Jazz dominant resolution |

The **altered scale** (7th mode of melodic minor) gives you all altered tensions: 1 b2(b9) #2(#9) 3 b5(#11) #5(b13) b7. Play melodic minor a half step above the dominant root.

## 9.3 Modulation

Changing key within a piece:

### Direct Modulation
- Jump to a new key with no preparation
- Common: raising the key by a half or whole step for the final chorus
- Example: song in C → abruptly shifts to Db for the last chorus

### Pivot Chord Modulation
- Find a chord that belongs to both keys and use it as the bridge
- C major → G major: the chord Em is iii in C and vi in G. Use it as the pivot.
- **C - Am - Em** [pivot: Em is now vi in G] **- D - G**

### ii-V Modulation
- Approach the new key with its ii-V
- C major → Eb major: play **Fm7 - Bb7** (ii-V of Eb) and then land on **Ebmaj7**
- This is the smoothest modulation — the ii-V announces the new key clearly

### Common Tone Modulation
- Hold a single note constant while the harmony changes around it
- The note G is in both Cmaj7 and Ebmaj7 — sustain G while the chord changes

## 9.4 Modes in Practice

The practical way to think about modes (not "start on a different degree"):

**Dorian** (1 2 b3 4 5 **6** b7):
- Natural minor with a natural 6th (that's the one difference)
- Sound: minor but warm, soulful
- Use over: ii chords in major keys, minor chord vamps
- Songs: "Oye Como Va" (Santana), "So What" (Miles Davis)

**Mixolydian** (1 2 3 4 5 6 **b7**):
- Major with a b7
- Sound: bluesy major, dominant
- Use over: V7 chords, dominant chord vamps
- Songs: "Norwegian Wood" (Beatles), "Sweet Home Alabama"

**Lydian** (1 2 3 **#4** 5 6 7):
- Major with a #4
- Sound: dreamy, floating, bright
- Use over: IVmaj7 chords, or any major chord when you want color
- Songs: "The Simpsons" theme, "Flying in a Blue Dream" (Satriani)

**Phrygian** (1 **b2** b3 4 5 b6 b7):
- Natural minor with a b2
- Sound: Spanish, dark, exotic
- Use over: iii chords in major keys, metal riffs, flamenco
- Songs: "White Rabbit" (Jefferson Airplane), "War" (Joe Satriani)

The signature note (bolded) is what distinguishes each mode from plain major or minor. Emphasize it.

## 9.5 Melodic Minor Harmony

The melodic minor scale (1 2 b3 4 5 6 7) generates its own set of modes, several of which are critical in jazz:

| Mode | Name | Formula | Use |
|------|------|---------|-----|
| 1st | Melodic Minor | 1 2 b3 4 5 6 7 | Over minMaj7 chords |
| 2nd | Dorian b2 | 1 b2 b3 4 5 6 b7 | Over sus(b9) chords |
| 3rd | Lydian Augmented | 1 2 3 #4 #5 6 7 | Over maj7#5 chords |
| 4th | Lydian Dominant | 1 2 3 #4 5 6 b7 | Over 7#11 chords |
| 5th | Mixolydian b6 | 1 2 3 4 5 b6 b7 | Over V7 resolving to minor |
| 6th | Locrian #2 | 1 2 b3 4 b5 b6 b7 | Over m7b5 chords |
| 7th | Altered | 1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7 | Over 7alt chords |

The **Altered scale** (7th mode) is the most used — it's the go-to scale over any heavily altered dominant chord.

## Exercises

### Exercise 9.1 — Tritone Substitution in Practice

**Goal**: Apply tritone subs to a ii-V-I progression.

**Original** (in C): Dm7 - G7 - Cmaj7

1. Play the original. Listen to the bass movement: D → G → C (up a 4th, down a 5th)
2. Apply tritone sub to V: **Dm7 - Db7 - Cmaj7**
3. Play it. Listen: bass now moves D → Db → C (chromatic descent!)
4. Apply tritone sub to ii as well (treat Dm7 as related to D, sub with Ab): **Abmaj7 - Db7 - Cmaj7**

Now apply in other keys:
- Key of G: Am7 - D7 - Gmaj7 → Am7 - **Ab7** - Gmaj7
- Key of F: Gm7 - C7 - Fmaj7 → Gm7 - **Gb7** - Fmaj7
- Key of Bb: Cm7 - F7 - Bbmaj7 → Cm7 - **B7** - Bbmaj7

### Exercise 9.2 — Altered Dominant Voicings

**Goal**: Learn practical altered dominant chord voicings.

**E7#9 (the Hendrix chord)**:
```
e|---
B|--8--
G|--7--
D|--6--
A|--7--
E|---
```
(X-7-6-7-8-X) — Play this and let it ring. That's the #9 sound.

Move it around:
- Fret 5: A7#9
- Fret 10: D7#9
- Fret 3: G7#9

**G7b9 voicing**:
```
e|--1--
B|--0--
G|--1--
D|--0--
A|---
E|--3--
```
(3-X-0-1-0-1)

**G7#5 voicing**:
```
e|--3--
B|--4--
G|--4--
D|--3--
A|---
E|--3--
```

Play each in a ii-V-I context: Dm7 → G7alt → Cmaj7. Try different altered voicings for the G7 each time.

### Exercise 9.3 — Diminished Passing Chords

**Goal**: Use diminished 7th chords as chromatic connectors.

1. Play: C - Dm
2. Insert: **C - C#dim7 - Dm**
3. C#dim7 voicing: X-4-2-3-2-X

Now apply to a longer progression in C:
- C - C#dim7 - Dm - D#dim7 - Em - F - F#dim7 - G

Each dim7 approaches the next diatonic chord from a half step below. Play slowly and hear the chromatic bass line: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G.

### Exercise 9.4 — Pivot Chord Modulation

**Goal**: Smoothly change keys using a shared chord.

Modulate from C major to G major:

1. Identify a pivot chord: **Em** is iii in C and vi in G
2. Play: **C - F - Am - Em** [you're in C]
3. Continue: **Em - Am - D7 - G** [now you're in G — the D7 is the giveaway, it's V7 of G]
4. Resolve: **G - C(IV in G) - D - G**

The key change should feel smooth, not jarring. The pivot chord (Em) is the door between the two keys.

Now modulate:
- G major → D major (pivot: Bm, which is iii in G and vi in D)
- C major → F major (pivot: Am, which is vi in C and iii in F)

### Exercise 9.5 — ii-V Modulation Chain

**Goal**: Modulate through multiple keys using ii-V's.

Start in C and modulate around the cycle of fourths:

1. **Cmaj7** (home key: C)
2. **Cm7 - F7** (ii-V of Bb) → **Bbmaj7** (now in Bb)
3. **Bbm7 - Eb7** (ii-V of Ab) → **Abmaj7** (now in Ab)
4. **Abm7 - Db7** (ii-V of Gb) → **Gbmaj7** (now in Gb)
5. Continue through all 12 keys...

Each ii-V clearly announces the new key. This is how jazz musicians navigate complex key changes.

### Exercise 9.6 — Modal Vamp Soloing

**Goal**: Improvise using a specific mode over a static chord.

**Dorian vamp**: loop Am7 for 8 bars at 90 BPM.
- Play A Dorian (A B C D E F# G) — emphasize the F# (the natural 6th that defines Dorian)
- Compare: play A Aeolian (A B C D E F G) over the same vamp. Hear how the F natural sounds darker?
- Switch back to Dorian. That F# is the Dorian "flavor"

**Mixolydian vamp**: loop A7 for 8 bars.
- Play A Mixolydian (A B C# D E F# G) — emphasize the G natural (the b7)
- This is the blues/rock dominant sound

**Lydian vamp**: loop Amaj7 for 8 bars.
- Play A Lydian (A B C# D# E F# G#) — emphasize the D# (#4)
- Notice the dreamy, floating quality

### Exercise 9.7 — The Altered Scale

**Goal**: Use the altered scale over a V7 chord resolving to I.

Over the progression **Dm7 - G7alt - Cmaj7**:

1. Over Dm7: play D Dorian (D E F G A B C)
2. Over G7alt: play G altered scale = Ab melodic minor (Ab Bb B Db Eb E Gb)
   - These notes over G: G Ab Bb B Db Eb E — that gives you R b9 #9 3 b5 #5 b7
3. Over Cmaj7: play C Ionian (C D E F G A B)

The altered scale creates maximum tension that resolves beautifully to the tonic. Practice at 60 BPM, one chord per bar.

### Exercise 9.8 — Comprehensive Substitution Workout

**Goal**: Apply multiple substitution techniques to one progression.

Start with a basic blues in C:
```
| C7    | C7    | C7    | C7    |
| F7    | F7    | C7    | C7    |
| G7    | F7    | C7    | G7    |
```

Apply substitutions one at a time:

**Step 1** — Add secondary dominants:
```
| C7    | C7    | C7    | C7(V7/IV)|
| F7    | F7    | C7    | A7(V7/ii)|
| Dm7 G7| F7    | C7    | G7    |
```

**Step 2** — Add tritone subs:
```
| C7    | C7    | C7    | Gb7(tritone sub of C7)|
| F7    | F7    | C7    | Eb7(tritone sub of A7)|
| Dm7 Db7| F7   | C7    | Db7(tritone sub of G7)|
```

**Step 3** — Add diminished passing:
```
| C7  C#dim7 | Dm7 D#dim7 | Em7  | A7    |
...and so on
```

Play each version and hear how the substitutions add movement and sophistication while the basic blues structure remains.
