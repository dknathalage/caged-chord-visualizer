# Chapter 4 — The CAGED System

The CAGED system maps the entire fretboard into 5 interlocking zones, each based on a familiar open chord shape. It's the bridge between knowing chord formulas (Chapter 3) and actually playing them anywhere on the neck.

Use the [CAGED Chord Visualizer](https://dknathalage.github.io/caged-chord-visualizer/) alongside this chapter.

## 4.1 The Five Open Shapes

Every guitar chord derives from one of these five open chord forms:

| Shape | Open Chord | Root String(s) | Open Voicing |
|-------|-----------|----------------|-------------- |
| **C** | C major | String 5 | X-3-2-0-1-0 |
| **A** | A major | String 5 | X-0-2-2-2-0 |
| **G** | G major | Strings 6, 1 | 3-2-0-0-0-3 |
| **E** | E major | String 6 | 0-2-2-1-0-0 |
| **D** | D major | String 4 | X-X-0-2-3-2 |

These are the building blocks. Every barre chord, every movable shape, every voicing you'll ever play comes from sliding one of these forms up the neck.

## 4.2 How CAGED Tiles the Fretboard

The shapes connect in this fixed sequence, repeating endlessly:

**... → C → A → G → E → D → C → A → G → E → D → ...**

For **any root note**, the five shapes give you five positions to play the same chord, covering the entire neck.

Example — **A major** in all 5 CAGED positions:
- **A shape**: open position (X-0-2-2-2-0), root on string 5
- **G shape**: fret 2 area, root on strings 6/1
- **E shape**: fret 5 barre (5-7-7-6-5-5), root on string 6
- **D shape**: fret 7 area, root on string 4
- **C shape**: fret 9 area, root on string 5

Open the visualizer, select key = A, type = Major, and see all 5 shapes laid out.

## 4.3 Barre Chord = Open Shape + Slide

The mechanics:
1. Take the open shape (e.g., E major: 0-2-2-1-0-0)
2. The open strings become a barre (your index finger replaces the nut)
3. Slide up — the barre fret is determined by the root note on the root string
4. E shape with barre at fret 1 = F major. Fret 3 = G major. Fret 5 = A major.

This works for all 5 shapes, though G and C shapes are harder to barre in practice.

## 4.4 Root Note Awareness

For each shape, know where the root lives:

| Shape | Root Location |
|-------|--------------|
| **E** | String 6 (and string 1) |
| **A** | String 5 |
| **D** | String 4 |
| **C** | String 5 (higher up than A shape) |
| **G** | String 6 (and string 1) |

To find the chord name, look at the root note on the root string. E.g., E shape with root at fret 8 on string 6 = C major (because fret 8 on string 6 is C).

## 4.5 Connecting Adjacent Shapes

Where one shape ends, the next overlaps. Adjacent shapes share chord tones in the overlap zone:

- **E shape → D shape**: the top notes of the E shape voicing are the bottom notes of the D shape
- **D shape → C shape**: similarly overlapping
- **C shape → A shape**: the most commonly used transition
- **A shape → G shape**: G shape wraps around to the bass strings
- **G shape → E shape**: completing the cycle

Practice moving between adjacent pairs to develop smooth transitions up and down the neck.

## Exercises

### Exercise 4.1 — Learn the Five Open Shapes

**Goal**: Play all 5 open shapes cleanly.

Play each open chord, letting every note ring. Check each string individually for buzz or muting:

1. **C major**: X-3-2-0-1-0
2. **A major**: X-0-2-2-2-0
3. **G major**: 3-2-0-0-0-3
4. **E major**: 0-2-2-1-0-0
5. **D major**: X-X-0-2-3-2

For each shape, identify:
- Which notes are the root (1)?
- Which is the 3rd?
- Which is the 5th?
- Are any notes doubled?

**Example for E major** (0-2-2-1-0-0):
- String 6, fret 0 = E (root)
- String 5, fret 2 = B (5th)
- String 4, fret 2 = E (root, octave)
- String 3, fret 1 = G# (3rd)
- String 2, fret 0 = B (5th)
- String 1, fret 0 = E (root, 2 octaves up)

Do this analysis for all 5 shapes.

### Exercise 4.2 — E Shape Barre Chords Across the Neck

**Goal**: Play major chords using the E shape at every fret.

1. Start at fret 1: **F major** (1-3-3-2-1-1)
2. Fret 2: **F# major**
3. Fret 3: **G major**
4. Continue up to fret 12: **E major** (back to the open chord, one octave up)

At each position:
- Name the chord (use your knowledge of string 6 notes from Chapter 1)
- Play cleanly — every string should ring
- Check: does the chord sound right?

### Exercise 4.3 — A Shape Barre Chords Across the Neck

**Goal**: Same drill with the A shape.

1. Start at fret 1: **A# / Bb major** (X-1-3-3-3-1)
2. Fret 2: **B major**
3. Fret 3: **C major**
4. Continue to fret 12: **A major**

Name each chord using your string 5 note knowledge.

### Exercise 4.4 — One Chord, Five Positions

**Goal**: Play a single chord in all 5 CAGED shapes.

Choose **G major**. Find all 5 positions:

1. **E shape**: fret 3 barre (3-5-5-4-3-3) — root on string 6
2. **D shape**: around fret 5-7 — root on string 4
3. **C shape**: around fret 7-10 — root on string 5
4. **A shape**: fret 10 barre (X-10-12-12-12-10) — root on string 5
5. **G shape**: open position (3-2-0-0-0-3) — root on string 6

Open the [visualizer](https://dknathalage.github.io/caged-chord-visualizer/) with Key=G, Type=Major and verify your positions.

Now do the same for:
- **C major** (all 5 shapes)
- **D major** (all 5 shapes)
- **A major** (all 5 shapes)

### Exercise 4.5 — CAGED Chord Walk

**Goal**: Walk up the neck through all 5 shapes smoothly.

Pick **C major**. Play the shapes in CAGED order ascending:

1. **C shape**: open (X-3-2-0-1-0)
2. **A shape**: fret 3 barre (X-3-5-5-5-3)
3. **G shape**: around fret 5-8
4. **E shape**: fret 8 barre (8-10-10-9-8-8)
5. **D shape**: around fret 10-13

Transition smoothly — try to maintain a beat. Use a metronome at 40 BPM (one shape per beat). Increase tempo as you improve.

Repeat for E major, A major, and D major.

### Exercise 4.6 — Minor CAGED Shapes

**Goal**: Apply CAGED to minor chords.

For each open major shape, learn the minor equivalent:
- **Em**: 0-2-2-0-0-0 (lower the G# to G — string 3, fret 1 → fret 0)
- **Am**: X-0-2-2-1-0 (lower the C# to C — string 2, fret 2 → fret 1)
- **Dm**: X-X-0-2-3-1 (lower the F# to F — string 1, fret 2 → fret 1)

Now play **A minor** in all 5 positions:
1. **Am shape**: open (X-0-2-2-1-0)
2. **Em shape**: barred at appropriate fret
3. **Dm shape**: higher position

Use the visualizer (Key=A, Type=Minor) to check.

### Exercise 4.7 — Chord Tone Spotlight

**Goal**: Identify the function of every note in a CAGED shape.

For **D major, A shape** at fret 5 (X-5-7-7-7-5):
- String 5, fret 5 = D → **Root**
- String 4, fret 7 = A → **5th**
- String 3, fret 7 = D → **Root** (octave)
- String 2, fret 7 = F# → **3rd**... wait, let me verify. String 2 is B, fret 7 = F#. F# is the 3rd of D. ✓
- String 1, fret 5 = A → **5th**

Do this for every shape of D major (all 5 CAGED positions). The visualizer can help you verify.

### Exercise 4.8 — Visualizer Exploration

**Goal**: Use the CAGED Chord Visualizer to study shape differences between chord types.

1. Open the [visualizer](https://dknathalage.github.io/caged-chord-visualizer/)
2. Set Key = G, Type = Major. Study the E shape
3. Switch to Type = Minor. Notice which dots moved (the 3rd lowers by one fret)
4. Switch to Type = Dom 7. Notice the added b7 note
5. Switch to Type = Maj 7. Compare the 7th position vs. Dom 7

For each chord type change, identify:
- Which interval changed?
- Which fret(s) moved?
- How does the shape "feel" different under your fingers?
