# Chapter 6 — Harmony and Chord Progressions

Harmony is how chords relate to each other. This chapter connects the chord formulas from Chapter 3 with the scale knowledge from Chapter 5, and explains why certain chord sequences sound "right."

## 6.1 Harmonizing the Major Scale

Stack 3rds on each scale degree to build the **diatonic chords** — the chords that naturally belong to a key:

| Degree | Numeral | Triad | Seventh Chord | Function |
|--------|---------|-------|---------------|----------|
| 1 | I | Major | Maj7 | Tonic |
| 2 | ii | Minor | Min7 | Subdominant |
| 3 | iii | Minor | Min7 | Tonic (substitute) |
| 4 | IV | Major | Maj7 | Subdominant |
| 5 | V | Major | Dom7 | Dominant |
| 6 | vi | Minor | Min7 | Tonic (substitute) |
| 7 | vii° | Diminished | Min7b5 | Dominant (substitute) |

**In the key of C major**:

| I | ii | iii | IV | V | vi | vii° |
|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| C | Dm | Em | F | G | Am | Bdim |
| Cmaj7 | Dm7 | Em7 | Fmaj7 | G7 | Am7 | Bm7b5 |

This table is the source of almost every chord progression you'll encounter in pop, rock, folk, country, and classical music.

## 6.2 Harmonizing the Natural Minor Scale

| Degree | Numeral | Triad | Seventh |
|--------|---------|-------|---------|
| 1 | i | Minor | Min7 |
| 2 | ii° | Diminished | Min7b5 |
| 3 | III | Major | Maj7 |
| 4 | iv | Minor | Min7 |
| 5 | v | Minor | Min7 |
| 6 | VI | Major | Maj7 |
| 7 | VII | Major | Dom7 |

**In A minor**: Am, Bdim, C, Dm, Em, F, G

Note: the v chord is minor — no leading tone for strong resolution. Harmonic minor raises the 7th to create a **V7** (E7 in Am), giving minor keys a proper dominant.

## 6.3 Functional Harmony

Every diatonic chord has a **function** — a role it plays in the musical story:

**Tonic (T)** — Home, stability, resolution
- I, iii, vi

**Subdominant (SD)** — Departure, motion, builds toward tension
- ii, IV

**Dominant (D)** — Maximum tension, needs to resolve back to tonic
- V, vii°

The fundamental motion: **T → SD → D → T**

This is a simplification, but it explains why most progressions work. I → IV → V → I is T → SD → D → T. So is I → ii → V → I. And vi → IV → V → I.

## 6.4 Common Progressions

| Name | Numerals | In C Major | Genre |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Pop Canon | I - V - vi - IV | C G Am F | Pop, rock (extremely common) |
| 50s | I - vi - IV - V | C Am F G | Doo-wop, oldies, ballads |
| 12-Bar Blues | I7(4) IV7(2) I7(2) V7(1) IV7(1) I7(2) | C7 F7 C7 G7 F7 C7 | Blues |
| Jazz ii-V-I | ii7 - V7 - Imaj7 | Dm7 G7 Cmaj7 | Jazz standard |
| Andalusian | i - VII - VI - V | Am G F E | Flamenco, rock |
| Plagal | IV - I | F - C | Gospel "Amen" |
| Axis | vi - IV - I - V | Am F C G | Pop (rotation of I-V-vi-IV) |
| Minor ii-V-i | iiø7 - V7(b9) - im7 | Bm7b5 E7b9 Am7 | Jazz minor |

## 6.5 Secondary Dominants

A **secondary dominant** is a V7 chord that resolves to a diatonic chord other than I.

Notation: **V7/X** means "the dominant 7th chord that resolves to X."

| Target | Secondary Dom | In C Major | Sound |
|--------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| ii (Dm) | V7/ii = A7 | C - **A7** - Dm | Adds surprise tension before ii |
| iii (Em) | V7/iii = B7 | C - **B7** - Em | Strong pull to iii |
| IV (F) | V7/IV = C7 | C - **C7** - F | Root becomes dominant |
| V (G) | V7/V = D7 | C - **D7** - G | Common in blues/rock |
| vi (Am) | V7/vi = E7 | C - **E7** - Am | Very common, bittersweet |

These are the simplest way to add harmonic color without leaving the key.

## 6.6 Borrowed Chords (Modal Interchange)

**Borrowing** means using a chord from the parallel key (same root, different mode).

In C major, you can borrow from C minor (or any C mode):

| Borrowed Chord | Source | Example in C | Sound |
|---------------|--------|-------------|-------|
| bVII | Mixolydian | Bb | Rock anthem sound |
| bVI | Aeolian | Ab | Epic, cinematic |
| bIII | Aeolian | Eb | Unexpected brightness |
| iv | Aeolian | Fm | Dark, emotional |
| bII | Phrygian | Db | Dramatic, Neapolitan |

Common progression with borrowing: **I - bVII - IV - I** (C - Bb - F - C) — classic rock.

## Exercises

### Exercise 6.1 — Harmonize Every Major Key

**Goal**: Build the diatonic chord table for all 12 keys.

Fill in the blanks:

**Key of G**: G - Am - Bm - C - D - Em - F#dim
- I=G, ii=Am, iii=Bm, IV=C, V=D, vi=Em, vii°=F#dim ✓

Now do:
1. **Key of D**: I=? ii=? iii=? IV=? V=? vi=? vii°=?
2. **Key of A**: ?
3. **Key of E**: ?
4. **Key of F**: ?
5. **Key of Bb**: ?
6. **Key of Eb**: ?

**Answers**:
1. D - Em - F#m - G - A - Bm - C#dim
2. A - Bm - C#m - D - E - F#m - G#dim
3. E - F#m - G#m - A - B - C#m - D#dim
4. F - Gm - Am - Bb - C - Dm - Edim
5. Bb - Cm - Dm - Eb - F - Gm - Adim
6. Eb - Fm - Gm - Ab - Bb - Cm - Ddim

### Exercise 6.2 — Progression Analysis

**Goal**: Given a chord progression, identify the key and Roman numerals.

Name the key and numerals for each progression:

1. G - C - D - G
2. Am - F - C - G
3. E - A - B - E
4. Dm - G - C
5. F - Bb - C - F
6. Em - Am - B7 - Em

**Answers**:
1. Key of G: I - IV - V - I
2. Key of C: vi - IV - I - V (or Key of Am: i - VI - III - VII)
3. Key of E: I - IV - V - I
4. Key of C: ii - V - I (jazz ii-V-I)
5. Key of F: I - IV - V - I
6. Key of Em: i - iv - V7 - i (harmonic minor — B7 has D# leading tone)

### Exercise 6.3 — Functional Harmony Identification

**Goal**: Label each chord's function (Tonic, Subdominant, Dominant).

For the progression in C major: **C - Am - Dm - G - Em - F - G7 - C**

| Chord | Numeral | Function |
|-------|---------|----------|
| C | I | ? |
| Am | vi | ? |
| Dm | ii | ? |
| G | V | ? |
| Em | iii | ? |
| F | IV | ? |
| G7 | V7 | ? |
| C | I | ? |

**Answers**: T - T - SD - D - T - SD - D - T

Notice: the progression alternates between tension and release, always resolving to tonic at the end.

### Exercise 6.4 — Secondary Dominant Insertion

**Goal**: Add secondary dominants to a basic progression.

Start with: **C - Dm - G - C** (I - ii - V - I)

1. Insert V7/ii before Dm: **C - A7 - Dm - G - C**
2. Insert V7/V before G: **C - Dm - D7 - G - C**
3. Insert both: **C - A7 - Dm - D7 - G - C**
4. Play each version and hear how the secondary dominants add motion

Now do the same with: **G - Em - Am - D - G** (I - vi - ii - V - I)
- Insert V7/vi before Em: G - **B7** - Em - Am - D - G
- Insert V7/ii before Am: G - Em - **E7** - Am - D - G

### Exercise 6.5 — Play Diatonic Chords in CAGED Positions

**Goal**: Play all 7 diatonic chords in the key of C using CAGED shapes.

Using the [visualizer](https://dknathalage.github.io/caged-chord-visualizer/) for reference, play these chords in one neck position (around frets 7-10):

1. Cmaj7 — C shape position
2. Dm7 — how does it sit relative to C?
3. Em7 — next position up
4. Fmaj7 — nearby
5. G7 — V chord
6. Am7 — relative minor
7. Bm7b5 — the most unusual one

The goal is to play all 7 chords without jumping more than 2-3 frets. This is how jazz guitarists comp — staying in one area and using close voicings.

### Exercise 6.6 — Borrowed Chord Exploration

**Goal**: Hear the sound of modal interchange.

In C major, play these progressions and listen to what the borrowed chord adds:

1. **C - Bb - F - C** (I - bVII - IV - I) — the Bb is borrowed from C Mixolydian. Classic rock sound.
2. **C - Ab - Bb - C** (I - bVI - bVII - I) — both borrowed from C Aeolian. Epic, anthemic.
3. **C - Fm - C** (I - iv - I) — Fm borrowed from C Aeolian. Bittersweet, emotional.
4. **C - Db - C** (I - bII - I) — Db borrowed from C Phrygian. Dramatic.

For each, note how the borrowed chord creates a surprise — it breaks expectation without sounding "wrong."
