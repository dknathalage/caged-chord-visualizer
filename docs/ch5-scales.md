# Chapter 5 — Scales and Modes

Scales are the melodic counterpart to chords. Where chords are intervals sounded simultaneously, scales are intervals played sequentially. The same interval knowledge from Chapter 2 applies here — scales are just a selection of intervals from the 12 available semitones.

---

## 5.1 The Major Scale

The foundation of Western harmony. Seven notes selected from 12:

**Formula: W W H W W W H** (W = whole step, H = half step)

In C: **C D E F G A B**

Intervals from the root: **1 2 3 4 5 6 7**

This is the reference scale — every other scale is described as modifications to this.

## 5.2 The Natural Minor Scale (Aeolian Mode)

**Formula: W H W W H W W**

Relative to major: **1 2 b3 4 5 b6 b7**

In A (natural minor): **A B C D E F G** — same notes as C major, starting on the 6th degree.

Every major key has a **relative minor** starting 3 semitones below (or on the 6th degree).

## 5.3 The Seven Modes

Each degree of the major scale generates a mode with a unique flavor:

| Mode | Degree | Formula | Character | Use Over |
|------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Ionian** | 1st | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 | Happy, resolved | Major chords, Imaj7 |
| **Dorian** | 2nd | 1 2 b3 4 5 6 b7 | Minor but bright | Minor chords, ii-7 |
| **Phrygian** | 3rd | 1 b2 b3 4 5 b6 b7 | Dark, Spanish | Minor chords, iii-7 |
| **Lydian** | 4th | 1 2 3 #4 5 6 7 | Dreamy, floating | Major chords, IVmaj7 |
| **Mixolydian** | 5th | 1 2 3 4 5 6 b7 | Bluesy, dominant | Dom7 chords, V7 |
| **Aeolian** | 6th | 1 2 b3 4 5 b6 b7 | Sad, dark | Minor chords, vi-7 |
| **Locrian** | 7th | 1 b2 b3 4 b5 b6 b7 | Unstable, diminished | m7b5 chords, viiø |

**Important**: don't think of modes as "starting on a different note." Think of them as the major scale with specific notes altered. Dorian = minor scale with a natural 6th. Mixolydian = major scale with a b7. This is how they're used in practice.

## 5.4 Pentatonic Scales

Five-note subsets that strip away the "passing" tones:

**Minor Pentatonic**: 1 b3 4 5 b7
- In A: A C D E G
- The essential rock/blues scale. Learn this first.

**Major Pentatonic**: 1 2 3 5 6
- In C: C D E G A
- Bright, country, pop

**Blues Scale**: 1 b3 4 b5 5 b7
- Minor pentatonic + the "blue note" (b5/tritone)
- In A: A C D Eb E G

## 5.5 Five Pentatonic Box Patterns

The minor pentatonic has 5 patterns that tile the fretboard — and they map exactly to the CAGED shapes:

| Pattern | CAGED Zone | Root Position |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Pattern 1 | E shape | Most common "box" |
| Pattern 2 | D shape | Extends up from pattern 1 |
| Pattern 3 | C shape | Middle zone |
| Pattern 4 | A shape | Common for chord soloing |
| Pattern 5 | G shape | Connects back to pattern 1 |

**A minor pentatonic, Pattern 1** (the most important pattern in rock guitar):
```
e|--5---8--|
B|--5---8--|
G|--5---7--|
D|--5---7--|
A|--5---7--|
E|--5---8--|
```
Root = fret 5 on string 6 (A).

## 5.6 Three-Note-Per-String (3NPS) Patterns

For the full 7-note major scale, use 3NPS patterns — three notes on each string:

**C major, starting on string 6 (pattern 1)**:
```
e|--7--8--10--|
B|--8--10-----|
G|--7--9--10--|
D|--7--9--10--|
A|--7--8--10--|
E|--8--10-----|
```

There are 7 patterns (one starting on each scale degree). These are excellent for building speed and connecting the entire neck.

## 5.7 Other Important Scales

| Scale | Formula | Character |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Harmonic Minor** | 1 2 b3 4 5 b6 7 | Classical, creates V7 in minor keys |
| **Melodic Minor** (asc.) | 1 2 b3 4 5 6 7 | Jazz, smooth minor |
| **Whole Tone** | 1 2 3 #4 #5 b7 | Dreamlike, only 2 transpositions |
| **Diminished HW** | 1 b2 b3 3 b5 5 6 b7 | Symmetric, 8 notes |
| **Diminished WH** | 1 2 b3 4 b5 b6 6 7 | Dominant diminished |

## Exercises

### Exercise 5.1 — Major Scale on One String

**Goal**: Hear and feel the major scale's interval structure (W W H W W W H).

1. Play the C major scale entirely on string 5:
   - C (fret 3) → D (fret 5) → E (fret 7) → F (fret 8) → G (fret 10) → A (fret 12) → B (fret 14) → C (fret 15)
2. Note the pattern: 2 frets, 2 frets, 1 fret, 2 frets, 2 frets, 2 frets, 1 fret
3. Play ascending and descending, saying interval numbers: "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8"
4. Now play G major on string 6: G (fret 3) → A (5) → B (7) → C (8) → D (10) → E (12) → F# (14) → G (15)
5. Do this in all 12 keys on strings 6 and 5

### Exercise 5.2 — Minor Pentatonic Box 1 in All Keys

**Goal**: Move the most important scale pattern to any key.

1. Play A minor pentatonic pattern 1 (root at fret 5, string 6):
```
e|--5---8--|
B|--5---8--|
G|--5---7--|
D|--5---7--|
A|--5---7--|
E|--5---8--|
```
2. Shift the entire pattern to play:
   - E minor pentatonic (root at fret 12)
   - G minor pentatonic (root at fret 3)
   - D minor pentatonic (root at fret 10)
   - B minor pentatonic (root at fret 7)
3. For each key: play ascending, descending, then improvise freely within the box
4. Use a metronome: start at 60 BPM (eighth notes), increase by 10 BPM when comfortable

### Exercise 5.3 — Connecting Pentatonic Boxes

**Goal**: Break out of a single box by connecting two adjacent patterns.

In A minor pentatonic:

1. Play pattern 1 (frets 5-8)
2. Play pattern 2 (frets 7-10)
3. Notice the overlap zone (frets 7-8)
4. Practice ascending through pattern 1 into pattern 2 without stopping
5. Practice descending through pattern 2 into pattern 1
6. Improvise across both patterns

Repeat connecting patterns 2→3, 3→4, 4→5, 5→1.

### Exercise 5.4 — Mode Comparison Drill

**Goal**: Hear how each mode sounds different over the same root.

Over a **C drone** (play the open C on string 5 as a repeating bass note, or use a looper/backing track):

1. Play C **Ionian** (C D E F G A B) — notice the bright, happy sound
2. Play C **Dorian** (C D Eb F G A Bb) — minor but with a bright 6th (A natural)
3. Play C **Phrygian** (C Db Eb F G Ab Bb) — dark, the b2 (Db) is the signature sound
4. Play C **Lydian** (C D E F# G A B) — floating, dreamy, the #4 (F#) stands out
5. Play C **Mixolydian** (C D E F G A Bb) — major but bluesy, the b7 (Bb) adds grit
6. Play C **Aeolian** (C D Eb F G Ab Bb) — natural minor, sad
7. Play C **Locrian** (C Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb) — unstable, dissonant

Play each one slowly, pausing on the "signature note" (the note that distinguishes it from plain major or minor).

### Exercise 5.5 — Scale-Chord Connection

**Goal**: See scale notes surrounding CAGED chord shapes.

1. Open the [CAGED Visualizer](https://dknathalage.github.io/caged-chord-visualizer/), set Key = A, Type = Minor
2. Look at the E-shape Am chord (fret 5 barre)
3. On your guitar, play the Am pentatonic box 1 around it (same area, frets 5-8)
4. Notice: the chord tones (A, C, E) are inside the scale pattern
5. Play the scale, but emphasize the chord tones — hold them longer, accent them
6. Now switch the visualizer to Type = Major. Play A major pentatonic in the same zone
7. Notice which notes changed (the 3rd went from C to C#)

Do this for:
- D minor / D minor pentatonic around the A-shape position
- G major / G major pentatonic around the E-shape position
- E minor / E minor pentatonic in open position

### Exercise 5.6 — The Harmonic Minor Sound

**Goal**: Hear why harmonic minor exists and when it's used.

1. Play A natural minor ascending: A B C D E F G A
2. Play A harmonic minor ascending: A B C D E F **G#** A
3. Hear the difference? The G# creates a **leading tone** — it wants to resolve up to A
4. Play the chords: Am - Dm - **E7** - Am
5. The E7 chord (E G# B D) contains the G# from harmonic minor. This is why harmonic minor exists — it gives minor keys a proper dominant (V7) chord
6. Now improvise over the progression Am - Dm - E7 - Am. Use natural minor over Am and Dm, switch to harmonic minor (raise G to G#) over the E7

### Exercise 5.7 — Blues Scale Licks

**Goal**: Use the blue note (b5) to add character to pentatonic lines.

In A blues scale (A C D Eb E G):

1. Play: fret 5 (A) → fret 8 (C) → fret 5 (A) on string 6. Basic call.
2. Add the blue note: fret 5 (A) → fret 6 (Bb? No — on string 4: fret 7 is A, fret 6 is Ab)...

Let's stay on one string for clarity. On string 5:
1. Fret 5 (D) → fret 6 (Eb, blue note) → fret 7 (E) — the classic half-step bend/slide through the blue note
2. Practice bending from Eb up to E (a half-step bend) — this is the essential blues sound
3. Lick: string 5 fret 7 (E) → string 5 fret 5 (D) → string 6 fret 5 (A) — a basic blues resolution
