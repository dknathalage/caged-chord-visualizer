# Chapter 3 — Building Chords from Intervals

Chords are not shapes to memorize. Chords are **groups of intervals stacked from a root note**. The shapes on the fretboard are just where those intervals happen to land. If you understand the formula, you can build any chord in any position.

---

## 3.1 Triads — Three-Note Chords

A triad is built by stacking two 3rds:

| Chord Type | Formula | Stacking | Example in C |
|-----------|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Major** | 1 3 5 | Major 3rd + Minor 3rd | C E G |
| **Minor** | 1 b3 5 | Minor 3rd + Major 3rd | C Eb G |
| **Diminished** | 1 b3 b5 | Minor 3rd + Minor 3rd | C Eb Gb |
| **Augmented** | 1 3 #5 | Major 3rd + Major 3rd | C E G# |

The difference between major and minor is **one note** — the 3rd moves by one semitone. This is the most important sound distinction in all of Western music.

## 3.2 Seventh Chords — Four-Note Chords

Add a 7th on top of the triad:

| Chord Type | Symbol | Formula | Example in C |
|-----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Major 7** | Cmaj7 | 1 3 5 7 | C E G B |
| **Dominant 7** | C7 | 1 3 5 b7 | C E G Bb |
| **Minor 7** | Cm7 | 1 b3 5 b7 | C Eb G Bb |
| **Half-diminished** | Cm7b5 / Cø7 | 1 b3 b5 b7 | C Eb Gb Bb |
| **Diminished 7** | Cdim7 / C°7 | 1 b3 b5 bb7(6) | C Eb Gb A |
| **Minor-Major 7** | CmMaj7 | 1 b3 5 7 | C Eb G B |
| **Augmented 7** | Caug7 / C7#5 | 1 3 #5 b7 | C E G# Bb |

The **dominant 7** is the most important — it creates tension that resolves. It's a major triad with a minor 7th.

## 3.3 Suspended Chords

Remove the 3rd and replace it:

| Type | Formula | Example in C | Sound |
|------|---------|-------------|-------|
| **sus2** | 1 2 5 | C D G | Open, ambiguous |
| **sus4** | 1 4 5 | C F G | Tense, wants to resolve to major or minor |

No 3rd = no major/minor quality. That's why they sound "suspended" — floating between major and minor.

## 3.4 Extended Chords

Extensions add color on top of seventh chords:

| Type | Formula | Notes in C |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **add9** | 1 3 5 9 | C E G D (no 7th) |
| **9** | 1 3 5 b7 9 | C E G Bb D |
| **m9** | 1 b3 5 b7 9 | C Eb G Bb D |
| **maj9** | 1 3 5 7 9 | C E G B D |
| **11** | 1 3 5 b7 9 11 | C E G Bb D F |
| **13** | 1 3 5 b7 9 11 13 | C E G Bb D F A |
| **6** | 1 3 5 6 | C E G A |
| **m6** | 1 b3 5 6 | C Eb G A |

On guitar, you can't play all notes of an 11th or 13th chord (only 6 strings). Common omissions:
- **5th**: almost always safe to drop — it doesn't define the chord quality
- **Root**: can be dropped if a bass player covers it
- **9th, 11th**: often dropped from 13th chords

## 3.5 Which Notes Define a Chord?

Priority from most to least essential:

1. **3rd** (or sus note) — defines major vs. minor
2. **7th** — defines the chord type (maj7 vs. dom7 vs. m7)
3. **Root** — names the chord (but can be played by bass)
4. **Extension** (9, 11, 13) — adds color
5. **5th** — unless altered (b5 or #5), it's the first to drop

## 3.6 Inversions

An inversion is when a note other than the root is the lowest sounding note:

| Inversion | Lowest Note | Example in C major |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Root position | Root (1) | C E G |
| 1st inversion | 3rd | E G C |
| 2nd inversion | 5th | G C E |
| 3rd inversion (7th chords) | 7th | B C E G |

Slash chords (like C/E) indicate the bass note: C chord with E in the bass = 1st inversion.

## Exercises

### Exercise 3.1 — Triad Formula Recall

**Goal**: Know every triad formula from memory.

Without looking at the tables above, write down (or say aloud) the formula and notes for each:

1. D major = ?
2. F# minor = ?
3. Bb diminished = ?
4. E augmented = ?
5. Ab major = ?
6. C# minor = ?
7. G diminished = ?
8. B augmented = ?

**Answers**:
1. D major: 1 3 5 = D F# A
2. F# minor: 1 b3 5 = F# A C#
3. Bb diminished: 1 b3 b5 = Bb Db E(Fb)
4. E augmented: 1 3 #5 = E G# C(B#)
5. Ab major: 1 3 5 = Ab C Eb
6. C# minor: 1 b3 5 = C# E G#
7. G diminished: 1 b3 b5 = G Bb Db
8. B augmented: 1 3 #5 = B D# G

### Exercise 3.2 — Seventh Chord Construction

**Goal**: Build any seventh chord from its formula.

Spell out the notes for each:

1. Gmaj7 = ?
2. A7 = ?
3. Em7 = ?
4. F#m7b5 = ?
5. Bbmaj7 = ?
6. D7 = ?
7. Cm7 = ?
8. Abdim7 = ?

**Answers**:
1. Gmaj7: G B D F#
2. A7: A C# E G
3. Em7: E G B D
4. F#m7b5: F# A C E
5. Bbmaj7: Bb D F A
6. D7: D F# A C
7. Cm7: C Eb G Bb
8. Abdim7: Ab B(Cb) D(Ebb) F(Gbb) — enharmonically Ab B D F

### Exercise 3.3 — Triad Shapes on Three Strings

**Goal**: Play triads on string groups across the neck.

Play C major (C E G) in close voicing on three adjacent string groups:

**Strings 4-3-2**:
- Root position: fret 10-9-8 (C E G? Let's verify: string 4 fret 10 = C, string 3 fret 9 = E, string 2 fret 8 = G) ✓
- 1st inversion: fret 2-0-1 (E G C: string 4 fret 2 = E, string 3 fret 0 = G, string 2 fret 1 = C) ✓
- 2nd inversion: fret 5-5-5 (G C E: string 4 fret 5 = G, string 3 fret 5 = C, string 2 fret 5 = E) ✓

Now do the same for:
- G major (G B D) on strings 4-3-2
- D minor (D F A) on strings 4-3-2
- A major (A C# E) on strings 3-2-1

### Exercise 3.4 — Chord Tone Identification

**Goal**: Given a chord voicing, name every note's function.

For each chord below, identify the interval of each note (R, 3, 5, b7, etc.):

1. **Am7 voicing**: A (string 5, fret 12) - E (string 4, fret 14) - G (string 3, fret 12) - C (string 2, fret 13)
   - A = ?, E = ?, G = ?, C = ?

2. **D7 voicing**: D (string 4, fret 12) - F# (string 3, fret 11) - A (string 2, fret 10) - C (string 1, fret 8)
   - D = ?, F# = ?, A = ?, C = ?

3. **Cmaj7 voicing**: C (string 5, fret 3) - E (string 4, fret 2) - G (string 3, fret 0) - B (string 2, fret 0)
   - C = ?, E = ?, G = ?, B = ?

**Answers**:
1. A = Root, E = 5th, G = b7, C = b3
2. D = Root, F# = 3rd, A = 5th, C = b7
3. C = Root, E = 3rd, G = 5th, B = 7th

### Exercise 3.5 — Major to Minor Conversion

**Goal**: Understand the one-note difference between parallel chords.

1. Play an open E major chord (0-2-2-1-0-0)
2. Lower the 3rd (G#) by one fret to make it minor → (0-2-2-0-0-0) = E minor
3. Identify which string/fret changed and why (the G# on string 3, fret 1 became G natural on string 3, fret 0)

4. Play an open A major chord (X-0-2-2-2-0)
5. Lower the 3rd (C#) by one fret → (X-0-2-2-1-0) = A minor
6. Which string/fret changed? (String 2, fret 2 → fret 1: C# became C)

7. Play an open C major chord (X-3-2-0-1-0)
8. Lower the 3rd (E) by one fret → (X-3-1-0-1-0)... this gives Cm but is very hard to finger
9. Why is this harder? (The E note appears on string 4 fret 2, lowering to Eb = fret 1 creates an awkward stretch)

**Takeaway**: Major → Minor is always just lowering the 3rd by one semitone. On guitar, sometimes this is easy (E major → Em) and sometimes it restructures the whole shape.

### Exercise 3.6 — Build From Scratch

**Goal**: Construct a chord voicing from a formula without using known shapes.

Build an Fmaj7 chord (F A C E) using strings 4-3-2-1:

1. Find F on string 4: fret 3
2. Find A on string 3: fret 2
3. Find C on string 2: fret 1
4. Find E on string 1: fret 0

Voicing: X-X-3-2-1-0. Play it. That's Fmaj7.

Now build:
- **Gm7** (G Bb D F) on strings 4-3-2-1
- **Bb** (Bb D F) on strings 5-4-3
- **Em7b5** (E G Bb D) on strings 4-3-2-1
