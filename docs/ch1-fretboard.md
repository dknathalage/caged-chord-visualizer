# Chapter 1 — The Fretboard as a System

Before playing anything musical, understand the instrument as a logical grid. The guitar fretboard is not random — it's a repeating pattern of 12 notes laid out across 6 strings with consistent geometric relationships.

---

## 1.1 How the Guitar Is Tuned

Standard tuning from low to high: **E A D G B E**

- Each string is tuned a **perfect 4th** (5 semitones) apart from the next
- **Except** G to B, which is a **major 3rd** (4 semitones)
- This single irregularity is why chord shapes shift when they cross the G-B string boundary
- The tuning is a compromise: it keeps common open chords playable while maintaining mostly uniform interval geometry

String numbers count from thinnest to thickest:
- String 1 = high E (thinnest)
- String 6 = low E (thickest)

## 1.2 The Chromatic Scale

12 notes, then it repeats:

```
C  C#  D  D#  E  F  F#  G  G#  A  A#  B  [C...]
     Db     Eb        Gb     Ab     Bb
```

Key facts:
- Every fret = one **half step** (semitone)
- Two frets = one **whole step** (tone)
- There is **no sharp/flat** between **B-C** and **E-F** — these are natural half steps
- Sharps (#) and flats (b) are two names for the same pitch (enharmonic equivalents): C# = Db

## 1.3 Notes on Each String (Open to Fret 12)

```
Fret:    0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   11   12
String 6 (E): E    F    F#   G    G#   A    A#   B    C    C#   D    D#   E
String 5 (A): A    A#   B    C    C#   D    D#   E    F    F#   G    G#   A
String 4 (D): D    D#   E    F    F#   G    G#   A    A#   B    C    C#   D
String 3 (G): G    G#   A    A#   B    C    C#   D    D#   E    F    F#   G
String 2 (B): B    C    C#   D    D#   E    F    F#   G    G#   A    A#   B
String 1 (E): E    F    F#   G    G#   A    A#   B    C    C#   D    D#   E
```

At fret 12, every string returns to the same note as the open string — one octave higher.

## 1.4 Octave Shapes

These geometric patterns let you instantly find the same note in a different position:

| From → To | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| String 6 → String 4 | Same fret |
| String 6 → String 3 | Up 2 strings, over 1 fret right |
| String 5 → String 3 | Same fret |
| String 5 → String 2 | Up 2 strings, over 1 fret right |
| String 4 → String 2 | Same fret |
| String 4 → String 1 | Up 2 strings, over 1 fret right |
| Any string → Same string | 12 frets up |

The "over 1 fret" adjustment on alternating pairs accounts for the G-B major 3rd tuning gap.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1.1 — Single String Note Naming

**Goal**: Name every note on one string without hesitation.

1. Pick string 6 (low E). Starting from the open string, say each note aloud as you play each fret from 0 to 12
2. Do it ascending: E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E
3. Do it descending: E, D#, D, C#, C, B, A#, A, G#, G, F#, F, E
4. Repeat on string 5 (A), then string 4 (D)
5. Time yourself — aim for under 15 seconds per string

**Target**: complete all 6 strings ascending and descending in under 3 minutes total.

### Exercise 1.2 — Random Note Finder

**Goal**: Find any named note on any string instantly.

1. Use this list of prompts (or have someone quiz you):
   - "Find A on string 6" → fret 5
   - "Find C on string 5" → fret 3
   - "Find F# on string 4" → fret 4
   - "Find B on string 3" → fret 4
   - "Find E on string 2" → fret 5
   - "Find G on string 1" → fret 3
2. Shuffle the order. Do 20 random note/string combinations
3. Goal: answer in under 3 seconds per note

**Self-check**: verify by counting up from the open string chromatically.

### Exercise 1.3 — Octave Jumping

**Goal**: Find the same note in multiple positions using octave shapes.

1. Play A on string 6, fret 5
2. Find A on string 4 using the octave shape → fret 5 (same fret, string 6→4)
3. Find A on string 3 using the octave shape from string 5 → string 5 fret 12 is A, string 3 fret 12 is also... wait. Let's be systematic:
   - A on string 6 = fret 5
   - A on string 4 = fret 7 (string 6→4: actually +2 frets due to tuning — but simpler to just know it's fret 7)

Actually, let's use the correct octave positions for A:
   - **String 6, fret 5**: A
   - **String 4, fret 7**: A (one octave up)
   - **String 2, fret 10**: A (two octaves up — adjust +1 for G-B gap)
   - **String 5, fret 12**: A (one octave up from open A)
   - **String 3, fret 2**: A
   - **String 1, fret 5**: A (two octaves up from string 6)

4. Do this for all 12 notes. For each note, find it on all 6 strings.

**Target**: for any given note, you can locate it on all 6 strings within 10 seconds.

### Exercise 1.4 — The Dot Map

**Goal**: Internalize the fretboard marker dots as navigation landmarks.

Standard dot positions: frets 3, 5, 7, 9, 12 (double dot), 15, 17, 19, 21, 24.

1. For each dot fret, name the note on every string:
   - **Fret 3**: G, C, F, A#, D, G
   - **Fret 5**: A, D, G, C, E, A
   - **Fret 7**: B, E, A, D, F#, B
   - **Fret 9**: C#, F#, B, E, G#, C#
   - **Fret 12**: E, A, D, G, B, E (same as open)
2. Use these as anchor points — if you need to find Bb on string 4, you know fret 7 is A, so Bb is fret 8

### Exercise 1.5 — String Pair Relationships

**Goal**: Understand the interval between each adjacent string pair.

1. Play the open string, then play the same note on the next higher string:
   - String 6 open (E) → String 5, fret 7 (E) — that's 7 frets, but the tuning gap is 5 semitones (perfect 4th)
   - Wait — fret 7 on string 5 is E? String 5 is A, fret 7 = E. Hmm, that's 7 semitones up from A, which is E. But the gap from string 6 to string 5 is a 4th (5 semitones). The note E on string 5 is at fret 7, meaning to play string 6's open note on string 5, you go to fret 5... no.

Let me simplify:

For each string pair, the same note is found at these fret offsets on the higher string:
   - **6→5**: 5 frets back (perfect 4th)
   - **5→4**: 5 frets back (perfect 4th)
   - **4→3**: 5 frets back (perfect 4th)
   - **3→2**: 4 frets back (major 3rd)
   - **2→1**: 5 frets back (perfect 4th)

2. Play any note on string 6. Find the same note on string 5 (5 frets higher on string 5). Continue to strings 4, 3, 2, 1.
3. Example: play C on string 6 (fret 8). Find C on string 5 (fret 3), string 4 (fret 10), string 3 (fret 5), string 2 (fret 1), string 1 (fret 8).
