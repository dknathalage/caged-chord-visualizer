# Chapter 2 — Intervals: The Language of Music

Intervals are the single most important concept in music theory. Every chord, scale, melody, and harmonic relationship is defined by intervals. If you internalize this chapter, everything else becomes a naming exercise.

## 2.1 What an Interval Is

An interval is the **distance between two notes**, measured in half steps (semitones).

- Play fret 3 and fret 7 on the same string → that's 4 half steps apart → a **major 3rd**
- The name doesn't change regardless of which notes they are — 4 half steps is always a major 3rd

## 2.2 The 13 Intervals Within One Octave

| Semitones | Interval Name | Abbreviation | From C | Sound/Character |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| 0 | Unison | R / 1 | C | Same note |
| 1 | Minor 2nd | b2 | Db | Tense, dissonant, "Jaws" theme |
| 2 | Major 2nd | 2 | D | Stepping, "Happy Birthday" first two notes |
| 3 | Minor 3rd | b3 | Eb | Sad, dark — first interval of a minor chord |
| 4 | Major 3rd | 3 | E | Happy, bright — first interval of a major chord |
| 5 | Perfect 4th | 4 | F | Open, strong — "Here Comes the Bride" |
| 6 | Tritone | b5 / #4 | F#/Gb | Unstable, dissonant — "The Simpsons" theme |
| 7 | Perfect 5th | 5 | G | Powerful, hollow — power chord |
| 8 | Minor 6th | b6 / #5 | Ab | Eerie, augmented feel |
| 9 | Major 6th | 6 | A | Sweet — "My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean" |
| 10 | Minor 7th | b7 | Bb | Bluesy, dominant — wants to resolve |
| 11 | Major 7th | 7 | B | Lush, jazzy, almost-octave tension |
| 12 | Octave | 8 | C | Same note, higher register |

## 2.3 Intervals on the Guitar Fretboard

**Same string**: just count frets. Fret 3 to fret 8 = 5 semitones = perfect 4th.

**Across strings**: the shapes depend on the string pair.

For strings tuned a perfect 4th apart (6→5, 5→4, 4→3, 2→1):

| Interval | Shape (fret offset on higher string) |
|----------|--------------------------------------|
| Unison | Same note = higher string, 5 frets back |
| Minor 2nd | Higher string, 4 frets back |
| Major 2nd | Higher string, 3 frets back |
| Minor 3rd | Higher string, 2 frets back |
| Major 3rd | Higher string, 1 fret back |
| Perfect 4th | Same fret on both strings |
| Tritone | Higher string, 1 fret forward |
| Perfect 5th | Higher string, 2 frets forward |

For the G→B string pair (major 3rd apart), shift everything 1 fret forward:

| Interval | Shape (fret offset on B string from G) |
|----------|----------------------------------------|
| Major 3rd | Same fret on both strings |
| Perfect 4th | B string, 1 fret forward |
| Perfect 5th | B string, 3 frets forward |

## 2.4 Interval Quality Rules

- **Perfect** intervals: unison, 4th, 5th, octave — these don't have major/minor variants, they're either perfect, augmented (+1), or diminished (-1)
- **Major/Minor** intervals: 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th — major is the default (from the major scale), minor is one half step smaller
- **Augmented**: one half step larger than perfect or major
- **Diminished**: one half step smaller than perfect or minor

## 2.5 Compound Intervals

Intervals larger than an octave:

| Interval | = Octave + | Semitones |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 9th | 2nd | 14 |
| 11th | 4th | 17 |
| 13th | 6th | 21 |

These matter for chord extensions (9th chords, 11th chords, 13th chords).

## Exercises

### Exercise 2.1 — Interval Construction on One String

**Goal**: Build every interval from a given root on a single string.

1. Start on string 5, fret 3 (C)
2. Play each interval ascending:
   - Minor 2nd: fret 4 (Db)
   - Major 2nd: fret 5 (D)
   - Minor 3rd: fret 6 (Eb)
   - Major 3rd: fret 7 (E)
   - Perfect 4th: fret 8 (F)
   - Tritone: fret 9 (F#/Gb)
   - Perfect 5th: fret 10 (G)
   - Minor 6th: fret 11 (Ab)
   - Major 6th: fret 12 (A)
   - Minor 7th: fret 13 (Bb)
   - Major 7th: fret 14 (B)
   - Octave: fret 15 (C)
3. Say the interval name as you play each note
4. Repeat starting from different roots: A (string 5, fret 12), E (string 6, fret 12), G (string 6, fret 3)

### Exercise 2.2 — Interval Recognition on Two Strings

**Goal**: Play and identify intervals using two-string shapes.

1. Start on string 5, fret 5 (D)
2. Play these intervals on string 4:
   - **Perfect 4th**: string 4, fret 5 (G) — same fret
   - **Perfect 5th**: string 4, fret 7 (A) — 2 frets forward
   - **Major 3rd**: string 4, fret 4 (F#) — 1 fret back
   - **Minor 3rd**: string 4, fret 3 (F) — 2 frets back
   - **Minor 7th**: string 4 fret 10 (C) — 5 frets forward
3. Now do the same from string 3 to string 2 (remember the +1 fret shift):
   - Start on string 3, fret 5 (C)
   - **Major 3rd**: string 2, fret 5 (E) — same fret (because G→B is already a major 3rd)
   - **Perfect 5th**: string 2, fret 8 (G) — 3 frets forward

### Exercise 2.3 — Interval Naming Drill

**Goal**: Given two notes, name the interval.

Name the interval between each pair (answers below):

1. C to E = ?
2. A to F = ?
3. D to A = ?
4. G to Bb = ?
5. E to C = ?
6. F to B = ?
7. B to F# = ?
8. Eb to Bb = ?
9. A to G# = ?
10. C to Gb = ?
11. D to F = ?
12. G to D# = ?

**Answers**:
1. Major 3rd (4 semitones)
2. Minor 6th (8 semitones)
3. Perfect 5th (7 semitones)
4. Minor 3rd (3 semitones)
5. Minor 6th (8 semitones)
6. Tritone / Augmented 4th (6 semitones)
7. Perfect 5th (7 semitones)
8. Perfect 5th (7 semitones)
9. Major 7th (11 semitones)
10. Tritone / Diminished 5th (6 semitones)
11. Minor 3rd (3 semitones)
12. Augmented 5th / Minor 6th (8 semitones)

### Exercise 2.4 — Interval Ear Training

**Goal**: Learn to recognize intervals by sound.

1. Play these intervals on guitar and **sing both notes** after playing:
   - **Minor 3rd**: fret 5 and fret 8 on any string — sing "sad"
   - **Major 3rd**: fret 5 and fret 9 — sing "happy"
   - **Perfect 5th**: fret 5 and fret 12 — sing "power chord"
   - **Octave**: fret 5 and fret 17 (or use the octave shape) — sing "same note, higher"

2. Reference songs for each interval:
   - **Minor 2nd** (1): Jaws theme
   - **Major 2nd** (2): Happy Birthday (first two notes)
   - **Minor 3rd** (3): Smoke on the Water riff, Greensleeves
   - **Major 3rd** (4): Oh When the Saints
   - **Perfect 4th** (5): Here Comes the Bride, Amazing Grace
   - **Tritone** (6): The Simpsons, Maria (West Side Story)
   - **Perfect 5th** (7): Star Wars (main theme), Twinkle Twinkle
   - **Minor 6th** (8): The Entertainer
   - **Major 6th** (9): My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean, NBC jingle
   - **Minor 7th** (10): Somewhere (West Side Story) — "There's a..."
   - **Major 7th** (11): Take On Me (chorus, "take ON")
   - **Octave** (12): Somewhere Over the Rainbow

3. Daily drill: play a random interval and try to name it before checking. Do 10 per day.

### Exercise 2.5 — Interval Chains

**Goal**: Build fluency by chaining intervals across the fretboard.

1. Start on C (string 5, fret 3)
2. Go up a **major 3rd** → E (fret 7)
3. Go up a **minor 3rd** → G (fret 10)
4. Go up a **major 3rd** → B (fret 14 or string 4, fret 9)
5. Go up a **minor 3rd** → D
6. Continue alternating major and minor 3rds

Notice: you've just outlined the notes of a C major chord (C-E-G) and continued the pattern. This is how chords are built — stacked 3rds.

Now try:
- Chain of **perfect 5ths**: C → G → D → A → E → B → F# → C# → G# → D# → A# → F → C (the circle of fifths!)
- Chain of **perfect 4ths**: C → F → Bb → Eb → Ab → Db → Gb → B → E → A → D → G → C (circle of fourths — same cycle, opposite direction)
